A web service that takes an images and returns the positive or negative possibility of  melanoma problem.

This project was inspired by a researcher group at Stanford university to predict skin cancer. However the result is not as good as theirs, due to the fact of a smaller dataset.

Machine Learning Background
---
Under the hood we use [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), but we added [Keras](https://keras.io) as an extra layer on top which makes it easy to create a new model.

Getting started
